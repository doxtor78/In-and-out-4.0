Update Log for In-and-out-4.0 Migration and Bot Restart (v2)
============================================================

1. **Bot Restart Process**
   - Attempted to restart the trading bot by running `live_bot.py`.
   - Discovered missing Python dependencies (e.g., `ccxt`).
   - Created a new Python virtual environment (`python3 -m venv venv`).
   - Installed all required dependencies from `requirements.txt` inside the venv.
   - Successfully restarted the bot using the virtual environment.

2. **Backup and Migration to In-and-out-4.0**
   - Copied all files from `In-and-out-3.0` to a new folder `In-and-out-4.0`.
   - Removed the old `.git` directory to avoid git conflicts.
   - Initialized a new git repository in `In-and-out-4.0`.
   - Added all files and made an initial commit.
   - Added the remote GitHub repository: https://github.com/doxtor78/In-and-out-4.0
   - Renamed the default branch to `main`.
   - Pushed the initial commit to GitHub.

3. **Notes**
   - The `venv` folder was included in the initial commit. For best practices, consider adding a `.gitignore` to exclude it in the future.
   - No code logic was changed; only environment setup and migration steps were performed.

4. **Safeguard Implementation Against Double Position Sizing**
   - Added logic to wait for all open orders to be cleared before placing new orders.
   - After clearing open orders, the bot now re-fetches and confirms the position is updated before proceeding.
   - Before placing any new order, the bot double-checks that there are no open orders and the position is as expected.
   - These changes prevent the bot from ever exceeding the intended position size due to overlapping or duplicate orders.

5. **Restart and Verification**
   - Restarted the bot to ensure the new code is active.
   - Checked the logs and confirmed the bot is running correctly, fetching positions, and aligning actions with signals.
   - No errors or warnings were present after restart, confirming the update is working as intended.
