# IN-AND-OUT-BOT Setup Instructions

This document provides instructions on how to set up and run the trading bot.

## 1. Create a Virtual Environment (Recommended)

It's best practice to run the bot in a dedicated Python virtual environment.

```bash
cd /Users/erhangocmez/IN-AND-OUT-BOT
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

## 2. Install Dependencies

Install the required Python packages using the `requirements.txt` file.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## 3. Create .env file for API Keys

The bot uses a `.env` file to securely load your API keys. Create a file named `.env` in the `/Users/erhangocmez/IN-AND-OUT-BOT` directory and add your BitMEX testnet API keys to it:

```
BITMEX_TESTNET_API_KEY="YOUR_API_KEY"
BITMEX_TESTNET_API_SECRET="YOUR_API_SECRET"
```

Replace `"YOUR_API_KEY"` and `"YOUR_API_SECRET"` with your actual keys.

## 4. System Time Synchronization

The bot is sensitive to time synchronization between your system and the exchange's servers. The bot now includes an automatic time-resync feature.

However, it is highly recommended to ensure your system clock is set to update automatically to prevent errors.

You can use the provided utility to check your time sync:
```bash
python check_time_sync.py
```

## 5. Running the Bot

Once the setup is complete, you can run the bot:

```bash
python live_bot.py
```

The bot will start running, log its activities to `bot.log` and the console, and manage its state in `state.json`.
