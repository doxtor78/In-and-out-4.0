Update Log for In-and-out-4.0 Migration and Bot Restart
=====================================================

1. **Bot Restart Process**
   - Attempted to restart the trading bot by running `live_bot.py`.
   - Discovered missing Python dependencies (e.g., `ccxt`).
   - Created a new Python virtual environment (`python3 -m venv venv`).
   - Installed all required dependencies from `requirements.txt` inside the venv.
   - Successfully restarted the bot using the virtual environment.

2. **Backup and Migration to In-and-out-4.0**
   - Copied all files from `In-and-out-3.0` to a new folder `In-and-out-4.0`.
   - Removed the old `.git` directory to avoid git conflicts.
   - Initialized a new git repository in `In-and-out-4.0`.
   - Added all files and made an initial commit.
   - Added the remote GitHub repository: https://github.com/doxtor78/In-and-out-4.0
   - Renamed the default branch to `main`.
   - Pushed the initial commit to GitHub.

3. **Notes**
   - The `venv` folder was included in the initial commit. For best practices, consider adding a `.gitignore` to exclude it in the future.
   - No code logic was changed; only environment setup and migration steps were performed.
